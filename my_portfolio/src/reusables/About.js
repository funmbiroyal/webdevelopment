            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I specialize in rapidly building software companies and web applications.<br/> I use an entrepreneurial 
            mindset to inform my design and engineering output</p>

           <p>I prioritize communication while building. I am an excellent communicator, <br/>
               both written and verbal. I use screen casts, video calls,<br/> and written words to
                lead teams built on trust and transparency.</p>

           <p>I am an expert in JavaScript, working primarily in React and Firebase, <br/>
               but I have experience working in a wide range of technologies including Node
                & <br/>Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, React Native,Gatsby,REST API design, CircleCI, <br/>
                3rd party APIs (Stripe, Discord, Slack, Amplitude, Google Auth, etc.), 
                AWS (S3, CloudFront,<br/> Cognito, Build Pipeline,Route53, ACM), and many more.</p>

           <p>Additionally, I am an experienced interface and user experience designer. I use Figma
                to<br/> communicate ideas through low and high fidelity mockups, design systems,
                 and clickable<br/> prototypes.</p>

                 <p>I ran Division 3 track (400m) at Rochester Institute of Technology,<br/> and still
